Intitulé de la mission : NonWEIRD: Collecting data about social behaviors and cognitions in hard-to-reach populations.  


Contexte : Psychological science has become known as a “WEIRD” discipline. That is, most participants in psychology are students from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic societies. Research has shown that these WEIRD students are not representative of the entirety of the human population. That presents psychologists with considerable problems. After all, they intend to develop theories that are representative of all humanity. The problem is logistical and technological: How can we collect data in harder to reach populations? The first step has been taken: Platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific Academic extend the reach from students to more general populations in WEIRD countries. The second step is to build platforms that can reach participants in nonWEIRD areas, and we are planning to build platforms for psychological research for the smartphone. People in more remote areas may not always have access to a computer, but do often have access to smartphones.   

Donneur d’ordre : présentation de la structure, du projet ou porteur de projet : The project will be led by the company “Mind-Science” (represented by Dr. Rick Klein, and supported by Dr. Hans IJzerman). Mind-Science is a Dutch company, but its representatives are currently in Grenoble. 

Contacts : Rick Klein (raklein22@gmail.com) and Hans IJzerman (h.ijzerman@gmail.com). 

Mission(s) confiée(s) : contexte et objectifs : 

End goal:
To create a smartphone app where participants can answer questions, participate in experiments, and receive payment. We can rely on some existing software (e.g., ExperienceSampler, Qualtrics) to integrate questionnaires. From the user side, the app should be able to send notifications when new studies are presented. Users should also be able to be paid via PayPal. From the researcher side, we should be able to build in quality control (e.g., how often were participants studies accepted), it should be flexible in terms of language, security of data, but it should also be easy for researchers to retrieve the data from an online platform. In addition, we will want to keep track of average study time and average payment (so that participants are paid fairly).   

Once the app is programmed and runs because of the programmers from fil rouge, then the programmers will get a 5% ownership in the app. The requirement for getting a 5% ownership is that the app works and that two first studies have been conducted on the app by outside researchers. 

Compétences requises
Experience programming in Python and Android. Preferably also some experience with deep/machine learning and data processing via GitHub. Willingness to program in other languages (e.g., Javascript, R).
